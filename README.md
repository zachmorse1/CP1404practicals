# CP1404 Python Practicals

A collection of Python practical exercises completed as part of the **CP1404 Programming 2** course at James Cook University.

This repository shows foundational Python skills, practical problem solving, and hands-on coding experience gained early in my development journey.

## 📍 About This Repository

These practicals contain small Python programs, exercises, and workflow practices that demonstrate core programming fundamentals. They include topics such as:

- Control structures (if statements, loops)  
- Functions and error handling  
- File input/output and exceptions  
- Lists and dictionaries  
- Classes and object-oriented design  
- Inheritance and extended class structures  
- Basic GUI development (Kivy in some practicals)  
- Testing and API basics

Many practicals contain code that you wrote to solve the requirements, including applied examples from coursework and problem-solving exercises. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to an individual practical assignment:

Each `prac_XX` folder contains:
- Python source files (`.py`)
- README or instructions used during development
- Optional assets used for that practical

## 🧠 What I Learned

Working through these practicals helped me develop:

- Confidence writing Python from syntax to structured programs  
- Familiarity with Python standard library modules  
- Practical debugging and testing approaches  
- Code organisation and readability skills  
- Early exposure to classes, testing, and simple GUIs

These foundational skills directly support higher-level projects and real-world code I’ve built since then. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📌 How to Explore

You can browse the individual practical folders to see:
- the exercises completed
- code style evolution over time
- solutions and approaches built from scratch

Each practical is self-contained and runnable using a Python 3 interpreter.

## 🧪 How to run Locally

To run a script locally:

1. Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
2. Open a terminal in the practical folder
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
